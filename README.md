This project allows you to use all the most well known Reinforcement Learning algorithms on the gymnasium environment.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to clone the repository and install the requirements.

```bash
git clone
cd ReinforcementLearning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For windows, often the gymnasium can only install if you have installed [Swig](http://www.swig.org/download.html) and added it to your path.
